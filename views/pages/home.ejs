                    I made this site because I'm tired of doing this stuff by hand, and I suspect you are too. Didn't get the classes you wanted? Go to the <a href="adddrop">Add/Drop Calculator</a> to see if that can't be changed. Wanna know what mods certain classes are happening, or certain teachers are teaching? Go to the <a href="search">Course/Teacher Searcher</a> and find out! Sooner or later, I'll move my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15nRyk7nFIQSMEbSGTqQiaYRbYvvEOB99JgOfxQK7oBo/edit?gid=269117890#gid=269117890">three-year-plan course selector sheet</a> here too, so stay tuned!
